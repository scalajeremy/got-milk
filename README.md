# Got Milk?

This is a little project made in 3 days for the hackathon [Hack in the Woods 2019](http://www.hackinthewoods.be/)

The goal was to make a little game (clicker) to show how little producers of milk are disavantaged against big corporation. How difficult it is for them to buy cows, ground for them and how to make profit out of it.
